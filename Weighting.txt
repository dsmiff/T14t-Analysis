By default Pythia generates unweighted events, ie all events in a run are on an equal footing. 
This means that corners of phase space with low xsec are poorly populated, as it should be.
In other words, events are distributed uniformly and each contribute with the same event weight to the whole sample,
done by mapping out the phase space of the process under consideration according to its different phase space channels, 
and then unweighting the sample of weighted events. 
However, sometimes in SUSY scans were are interested in exploring such corners, in order to gain a better understanding 
of the physics. As an example, take the jet xsec in hadron collisions, which drops rapidly with increasing jet Pt. 
This may be solved by prescaling event rates already at the trigger level, so that all high Pt events are saved but only
a fraction of the lower Pt ones are. 

Two approaches can be used. The first is to piece together results from the different subruns, where each subrun is 
restricted to some region of phase space. Within each subrun all events then have the same weight, but subruns have to 
be combined according to their relative xsec
The other approach is to let each event come with an associated weight, that can vary smoothly as a function of Pt. 

The phase space can be sliced in many different ways. However, for the jet rate and many other processes, the most
natural variable would be Pt. One would expect a strong correlation between the Pt scale and the jet Pts. 
Therefore the full Pt range can be subdivived into a set of ranges by using CKIN(3) and CKIN(4) variables as lower 
and upper limits.
